A super-fresh iPhone calculator app that was built for a [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/forum/forum-contest-calculator-app-for-ios) forum competition. It was like a mini-hackathon, and was really fun.

Check out [@colbyl](https://github.com/colbyl)'s project, [minus](https://github.com/colbyl/minus). A lot of work went into it and I had a great time competing with him.

Oh, and swipe down with two fingers! That's pretty cool.

This app was built to learn and have fun, so it's open source, but I'd really appreciate if you didn't take it and sell it or something. That'd suck.
