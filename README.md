# Combine

A super-fresh iPhone calculator app that was built for a [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/forum/forum-contest-calculator-app-for-ios) forum competition.

This app was built to learn and have fun, so it's open source, but I'd really appreciate if you didn't take it and sell it or something. That'd suck.
